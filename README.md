# Reinforced learning experiment with a MakeBlock mBot using ConvNetJS

Based on [Andrej Karpathy](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/)'s [ConvNetJS Deep Q Learning Demo](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/rldemo.html). mBot is controlled from nodejs via BLE using [mbot_nodebots](https://github.com/Makeblock-official/mbot_nodebots).
